# panda3d-simplematcap

This is a simple render pipeline for [Panda3D](https://www.panda3d.org) that
uses matcap instead of lights to render a scene.

## Features

 * Instead of materials and different kinds of light, scenes are rendered using a matcap shader and respective textures.
 * Supports running on a wide range of hardware with an easy OpenGL 2.1+ requirement
